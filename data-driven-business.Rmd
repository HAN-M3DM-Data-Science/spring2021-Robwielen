## What features define a data driven business?

A high end mature company continually works to improve their data science processes (and not just the solution). Data scientist at firms that are mature should have the confidence that when they propose an investment to improve data science processes, that their suggestions will be met with informed and open minds. These companies will test under conditions that mimic as closely as possible the actual business setting.

It is hard to assess what data science maturity is, but it is essential to getting the best out of the current capabilities of a company, and improving these capabilities (Provost & Fawcett, 2013).

## What are the transformation steps towards a mature data driven business?
To start the data transformation a company needs know where it is at the moment, so making a benchmark, and what the point of departure is. If a company is trying to get to a vision or an end stage of a transformation it needs to know what the starting point is to get to the point of arrival. 
A lot of organizations are fairly data immature. They donâ€™t value the data and do not look after the data. By using a data maturity model, companies can benchmark this process.
